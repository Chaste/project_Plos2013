Welcome to the Chaste wiki.

This section contains pages generated automatically from the source code accompanying [http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002970 Chaste: an open source C++ library for computational physiology and biology], 
our paper in PLoS Computational Biology.

'''The code has been updated to work with the latest release: Chaste v3.4.'''

Before running these examples you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies] and the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html source code for version 3.4].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage.
For manual installation of each dependency see InstallGuides/InstallGuide.

The paper is organised around four examples that are annotated and explained here.
Before looking at these, you may wish to look at some of the [UserTutorials basic user tutorials].

Click on the images below to go to the annotated code that defines the simulation for each case.
The code required to run these examples can be downloaded from [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download the main download site].
For further information on using Chaste to solve these and related problems, see our [wiki:ChasteGuides extensive guide material].
