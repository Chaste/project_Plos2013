Welcome to the Chaste wiki.

This section contains pages generated automatically from the source code accompanying "Chaste: an open source C++ library for computational physiology and biology", our paper under submission to PLoS Computational Biology.

Before running these examples you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies] and the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html source code for version 3.1].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage.
Note that Chaste is only supported on Linux/Unix systems, so users of Windows or Mac OS X will need to follow the virtual machine route.
For manual installation of each dependency, on any version of Linux, see DeveloperInstallGuide.

The paper is organised around four examples that are annotated and explained here.
Before looking at these, you may wish to look at some of the [UserTutorials basic user tutorials].

Click on the images below to go to the annotated code that defines the simulation for each case.
The code required to run these examples can be downloaded from [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download the main download site].
For further information on using Chaste to solve these and related problems, see our [wiki:ChasteGuides extensive guide material].
